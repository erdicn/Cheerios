  abstract = {In a recent time, a new computational technique, based on the resolution of a Boltzmann Equation in a discrete lattice with appropriate symmetries, has been proposed as an alternative tool to investigate problems in the domain of two and three-dimensional fluid-dinamics. The Lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE) is essentially the kinetic equation resulting from ensemble-averaging of the discrete dynamics of the Frisch-HasslacherPomeau (FHP) cellular automaton (and its generalitations) supplemented with the assumption of molecular chaos. The idea is that instead of solving the boolean equations which govern the microdynamical evolution of the cellular automaton (the equivalent of Hamilton equations in classical mechanics), one only aims to follow the evolution of the means populations living in the lattice. A definite advantage of the LBE formulation is the suppression of the large amount of noise which usually plagues cellular automata (CA) simulations.},

CA hysteresis (i.e., the difference between the advancing and receding CAs) due to roughness on a flat surface has been recognized but is not considered in the stability analysis of floating particles. In this study, the CA of single floating spheres at the air-water interface was determined directly from the deformed meniscus by applying a new method recently developed by our team (Feng, D.-x. and Nguyen, A. V., 2016. A novel quantitative analysis of the local deformation of the air-water surface by a floating sphere. Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects, Vol. 504, pp. 407-413). The experiments for each of the single spheres were repeated to estimate the variation in the CA. The experimental results show a normal distribution of the CA. The CA hysteresis occurs randomly because of the dispersion of small-scale surface roughness. This random hysteresis substantially affects the stability analysis of floating spheres. The analysis also shows that the CA determined by the force balance method (valid for ideally smooth surfaces) yields higher values than those determined on the basis of the deformed meniscus around the particle. This difference is attributed to the effect of surface roughness on the CA hysteresis, which should be considered in analyses of the stability and detachment of floating particles.},

It is found that the force between parallel vertical plates or parallelipipeds can be repulsive if one of the contact angles is acute and the other obtuse.

We perform finite element simulations of the two-phase flow system in a bounded two-dimensional geometry. The fluid interface is modeled with a phase-field method which is coupled to the Navier-Stokes equations to solve for the flow dynamics. The interfacial deformations are caused by the buoyant weight of the particle, which results in curved menisci. We compute drag coefficients as a function of the three-phase contact angle, the viscosity ratio of the two fluids, and the particle density. Our results show that, for some parameter values, large drag forces are not necessarily correlated with large interfacial distortions and that a lower drag may actually be achieved with non-flat interfaces rather than with unperturbed ones.},

Before his death in 1879 at the age of 48, Clerk Maxwell had made major contributions to many areas of theoretical physics and mathematics, not least his discoveries in the fields of electromagnetism and of the kinetic theory of gases, which have been regarded as laying the foundations of all modern physics. He is generally considered the third most important physicist of all time, after Newton and Einstein. These collected shorter works, beginning with a paper written at the age of 15, show the wide range of Clerk Maxwell's interests across mathematics, physics and chemistry.},

  abstract = {A quantitative study of the law of force between bubbles floating on a fluid has been made and the results exhibited in the form of a potential energy-distance curve. The main approximations made are that the inclination of the surface of the fluid is small (so that the equations for the surface become linear), and that the submerged portion of the bubble remains spherical. The latter assumption restricts the validity of the results to small bubbles of about 3·0 mm. diameter and less.                            One object of the work was to determine the size of bubble which simulated most nearly a typical atomic interaction curve. This application arises in connexion with Prof. Bragg's ‘bubble’ model of crystal lattices. Exact simulation cannot be expected, for the bubble model is two-dimensional, and also does not exert forces analogous either to Coulomb repulsion or to the metallic bond. It can be shown, however, that the law of force between bubbles of a particular size is a remarkably close fit to the law of force between inert gas atoms, that is, to an interaction consisting of a van der Waals attraction and a short-range or ‘overlap’ repulsion. Fig. 4 illustrates this point. The two full curves are the energy-distance curves for krypton and argon atoms (plotted from Fowler,               Statistical Mechanics               , 2nd ed., Chapter x, Table 29). The circles mark the corresponding curve for bubbles with α = 1·0 (i.e. of diameter 3 mm. in soap solution). The units of energy and distance are chosen so as to bring the minimum of each curve to the point (1, − 50). It will be seen that the curves are remarkably similar over the range shown.},

  abstract = {Objects that float at the interface between a liquid and a gas interact because of interfacial deformation and the effect of gravity. We highlight the crucial role of buoyancy in this interaction, which, for small particles, prevails over the capillary suction that is often assumed to be the dominant effect. We emphasize this point using a simple classroom demonstration, and then derive the physical conditions leading to mutual attraction or repulsion. We also quantify the force of interaction in some particular instances and present a simple dynamical model of this interaction. The results obtained from this model are then validated by comparison to experimental results for the mutual attraction of two identical spherical particles. We conclude by looking at some of the applications of the effect that can be found in the natural and manmade worlds.},
